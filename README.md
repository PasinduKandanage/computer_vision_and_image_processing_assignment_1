Basic Operations (Intensity, Filtering, Rotation, Resolution)

Python scripts to perform fundamental image processing operations:  
- **Intensity Level Reduction**:  Reduce grayscale levels (256 → 2, 4, 8, etc.)  
- **Spatial Averaging**: Blur images using kernels (3×3, 10×10, 20×20 kernels)  
- **Image Rotation**: Rotate images by 45° and 90° (45°, 90°)  
- **Block Averaging**: Reduce resolution using non-overlapping blocks (Non-overlapping 3×3, 5×5, 7×7 blocks)  

**Tech Stack**:  
- Python 3  
- OpenCV (`cv2`) 
- NumPy
