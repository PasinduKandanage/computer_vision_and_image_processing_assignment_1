Basic Operations (Intensity, Filtering, Rotation, Resolution)

Python scripts for fundamental image processing tasks:  
- **Intensity Level Reduction** (256 → 2, 4, 8, etc.)  
- **Spatial Averaging** (3×3, 10×10, 20×20 kernels)  
- **Image Rotation** (45°, 90°)  
- **Block Averaging** (Non-overlapping 3×3, 5×5, 7×7 blocks)  

**Tech Stack**:  
- Python 3  
- OpenCV ("cv2")  
- NumPy
